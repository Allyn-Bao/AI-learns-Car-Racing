# AI-learns-Car-Racing

This project contains an F1 car racing game with origial artwork, An image procesing algorithm using OpenCV which allows user to import any map and the game will determine the track boundarys.
Then a reinforcement model is trained using stable baseline to learn to control the car and play the game with out crash, and to complete the fastest lap possible.
